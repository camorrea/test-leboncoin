# test-leboncoin

test-leboncoin is a simple, responsive (mobile first) and accessible messaging react app

`json-server` : fake API

`axios` : to ease API calls

`styled-components` : for CSS

`jest` : snapshot testing

## Install

To install, just run `npm i`

`npm start` will start the server and the client concurently

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Redux ?

Everything in this app was easy to handle with hooks, that's why I choosed not to put Redux, it would have add some complexity with a small gain.
